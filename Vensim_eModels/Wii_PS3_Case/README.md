The x.mdl file is an SD model file for Ventana Systems Vensim. It utilizes Vemsim's subscript functionality for modeling two-sided markets.

To run these model files, you need the paid versions of Vemsim Professional or Vensom DSS. Variables and constant names in the models are written in English.

Vensim has changed the notation of models to its own format since Version 10. To change to the traditional system dynamics notation and display the model, specify the following
