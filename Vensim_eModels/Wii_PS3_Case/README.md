The x.mdl file is an SD model file for Ventana Systems Vensim. It utilizes Vemsim's subscript functionality for modeling two-sided markets.

To run these model files, you need the paid versions of Vemsim Professional or Vensom DSS. Variables and constant names in the models are written in English.

Vensim has changed the notation of models to its own format since Version 10. To change to the traditional system dynamics notation and display the model, specify the following

［Select the View icon -> “Traditional Sketch Style”.

Wii and PS3 inter-platform competition model -> Wii_PS3_Case

Service provider migration flag=0. Fixed to 1 units sold per user. Withdrawal action flag=0.

Model 0: Multiply the network effect coefficient by the intersection of the number of adopters on the other side and the change in the number of complements -> 0_Wii_PS3_eModel.mdl.

Model 1: Multiply the network effect coefficient only by the degree of change in the number of recruits on the other side (formulation of the cross-side network effect) -> 1_Wii_PS3_eModel.mdl.

Model 2: Multiply the network effect coefficient only by the degree of change in complements on the other side (formulation of indirect network effect)-> 2_Wii_PS3_eModel.mdl.
